    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p> Hello, if you so just so happen to stumble upon this webpage, lets start off with an introduction. I am Oswaldo . My name sounds unique right? That's what most people say. Actually to be quite honest, most people don't call me by my actually name. Rather they call me by Oz or Ozzie which are my nicknames. </p>
    
    <h3>Random Fact Number 1</h3>
<p> I like to travel... <strong> ALL LOT</strong>. Traviling around different places in the world is a dream of mine. I'd like to go vist Europe someday but first I gotta save up money and plan ahead of time. I'd really like to vist the country Switzerland as appaerenatly the citizens are some of the <em>happist</em> people in the world. Also I think the  country as a whole is beautiful. From its mountain terrians, from the crtsyal clean waters, and the house landscapes. </p>
